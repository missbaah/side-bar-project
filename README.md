## Task

The task of this project was to create the functionality for side bar JS. The sidebar is supposed to show up when the toggle button is clicked and when the close btn is clicked, it disappears

## What I learned

This project further reinforced the lessons on **.classList** and its sub methods. For this project, I used the **.toggle** method to add and remove the class for the toggle button. For the close button, I used the **.remove** method is remove the class that displays the side bar.

## Error lessons

There where no error lessons
